####Short Answer
1. Why do programmers use pseudocode?

A: 

Programmers use pseudocode as a design method to properly define the logic flow of a program in a plain human speaking language format such as English. This also helps non-programmers
understand how the program works without having to worry program syntax when collaborating with the project.     

>2. If you run pseudocode on your computer what would happen? 

A:

Nothing, pseudocode is meant for humans to read. Computers do not understand pseudocode. This is because pseudocode is not syntactiacally correct

####Programming Assignment
>Write the following algorithms in pseudocode:

>Create a function that takes two numbers and prints out the greater number.

```
FUNCTION addition 

INPUT first number 

INPUT second number

SUM = first number + second number

PRINT SUM

END FUNCTION

```

>Create a function that prints out the numbers from 1 to 100.

```
FUNCTION count

FOR count = 1 TO 100

PRINT count

END FUNCTION

```

>Create a function that searches for a specific entry in a phonebook.

```
FUNCTION search

INPUT search entry

IF search entry === TRUE

PRINT search entry Found

ELSE

PRINT Not Found

END FUNCTION
```

>Using the pseudocode you wrote for the previous question, implement it in any computer language of your choice.

```javascript

var arr = ['alpha','bravo','charlie','delta','echo'];

function search(arr,entry){
  
  var find = arr.includes(entry);
    
  if(find===true){
    return entry;
  }
  
  else {
    return "Not Found";
  }
  
}
console.log(search(arr,'charlie'));


```
